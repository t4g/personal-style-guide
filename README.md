# .a miniRFC.

## Personal style and design convension.

### Abstract.
This resource acts in part as 1.) a declaration of my currently observed coding style convensions, 2.) to serve as a personal and single evolving authority of these convensions and 3.) be a public [for what its worth] undertaking by myself to use these convensions (where mum lets me). 

> **NOTES**
> > This resource tries to follow RFC style and defer to offical IETF resources where possible.

> > _This document occasionally uses terms that appear in capital letters.
   When the terms **"MUST"**, **"MUST NOT"**, **"SHOULD"**, **"SHOULD NOT"**, and **"MAY"**
   appear capitalized, they are being used to indicate particular
   requirements of this specification.  A discussion of the meanings of
   the terms **"MUST"**, **"SHOULD"**, and **"MAY"** appears in [RFC-1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc1123); the
   terms **"MUST NOT"** and **"SHOULD NOT"** are logical extensions of this
   usage._
